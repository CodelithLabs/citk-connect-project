// 🛑 DEPRECATED: INSECURE REST IMPLEMENTATION
// This file has been replaced by the secure Firebase SDK implementation.
// Please use: lib/ai/services/gemini_service.dart
//
// Why?
// 1. The old service exposed the API Key in raw HTTP requests.
// 2. The new service uses Firebase Auth & App Check for security.
// 3. The new service supports "AI Monitoring" in Firebase Console.

// If you have imports pointing here, update them to:
// import 'package:citk_connect/ai/services/gemini_service.dart';
